To achieve the same effect as human motion, humanoid robots use mainly rotary actuators. They can be either electric, pneumatic, hydraulic, piezoelectric or ultrasonic.Hydraulic and electric actuators have a very rigid behavior and can only be made to act in a compliant manner through the use of relatively complex feedback control strategies. While electric coreless motor actuators are better suited for high speed and low load applications, hydraulic ones operate well at low speed and high load applications. Piezoelectric actuators generate a small movement with a high force capability when voltage is applied. They can be used for ultra-precise positioning and for generating and handling high forces or pressures in static or dynamic situations. Ultrasonic actuators are designed to produce movements in a micrometer order at ultrasonic frequencies (over 20 kHz). They are useful for controlling vibration, positioning applications and quick switching. Pneumatic actuators operate on the basis of gas compressibility. As they are inflated, they expand along the axis, and as they deflate, they contract. If one end is fixed, the other will move in a linear trajectory. These actuators are intended for low speed and low/medium load applications. Between pneumatic actuators there are: cylinders, bellows, pneumatic engines, pneumatic stepper motors and pneumatic artificial muscles" + "<br>"

Sophia is a highly sought-after speaker at business conclaves and has met face-to-face with key decision-makers in banking, insurance, property development, auto manufacturing, media, and entertainment. In addition, Sophia has appeared as a panel member and presenter in high-level conferences. Sophia is named as the world’s first United Nation Innovation Champion.

        <h1>HUMANOIDS</h1>
        <hr>
        <P>A humanoid robot is a robot with its body shape built to resemble the human body. The design may be for functional purposes, such as interacting with human tools and environments, for experimental purposes, such as the study of bipedal locomotion,
            or for other purposes. In general, humanoid robots have a torso, a head, two arms, and two legs, though some forms of humanoid robots may model only part of the body, for example, from the waist up. Some humanoid robots also have heads designed
            to replicate human facial features such as eyes and mouths. Androids are humanoid robots built to aesthetically resemble humans.</P>
        <P>Humanoid robots are now used as research tools in several scientific areas. Researchers study the human body structure and behavior (biomechanics) to build humanoid robots. On the other side, the attempt to simulate the human body leads to a better
            understanding of it. Human cognition is a field of study which is focused on how humans learn from sensory information in order to acquire perceptual and motor skills. This knowledge is used to develop computational models of human behavior
            and it has been improving over time. It has been suggested that very advanced robotics will facilitate the enhancement of ordinary humans. See transhumanism. Although the initial aim of humanoid research was to build better orthosis and prosthesis
            for human beings, knowledge has been transferred between both disciplines. A few examples are powered leg prosthesis for neuromuscularly impaired, ankle-foot orthosis, biological realistic leg prosthesis and forearm prosthesis. Besides the
            research, humanoid robots are being developed to perform human tasks like personal assistance, through which they should be able to assist the sick and elderly, and dirty or dangerous jobs. Humanoids are also suitable for some procedurally-based
            vocations, such as reception-desk administrators and automotive manufacturing line workers. In essence, since they can use tools and operate equipment and vehicles designed for the human form, humanoids could theoretically perform any task
            a human being can, so long as they have the proper software. However, the complexity of doing so is immense. They are also becoming increasingly popular as entertainers. For example, Ursula, a female robot, sings, plays music, dances and speaks
            to her audiences at Universal Studios. Several Disney theme park shows utilize animatronic robots that look, move and speak much like human beings. Although these robots look realistic, they have no cognition or physical autonomy. Various
            humanoid robots and their possible applications in daily life are featured in an independent documentary film called Plug & Pray, which was released in 2010. Humanoid robots, especially those with artificial intelligence algorithms, could
            be useful for future dangerous and/or distant space exploration missions, without having the need to turn back around again and return to Earth once the mission is completed.</P>
